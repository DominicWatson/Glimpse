# Wilber

Wilber is a downstream fork of the GNU Image Manipulation Program.

## What is different about Wilber?
For now, not a lot! The main aim currently is to provide a downstream fork of
the GNU Image Manipulation Program that has a less offensive name.

Issue that got dismissed: https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gimp/issues/3617

Upstream project's explanation:
https://www.gimp.org/docs/userfaq.html#i-dont-like-the-name-gimp-will-you-change-it

I and many other people don't feel that using the long-form name is sufficient
to address the concerns people have raised about this software. A rebranding
exercise that still provides the world with the brilliant features of the GNU
Image Manipulation Program without its adoption being stymied by negative
perceptions about the ableist/vaguely-sexual "Gimp" name can in our minds only
be a good thing!

## How can I contribute?
Take a look at the [issues](https://github.com/TreacherousNexus/Wilber/issues)
page and see where you can contribute. There are definitely gaps in my
([Bobby Moss](https://github.com/TreacherousNexus)'s) knowledge, and the more
people fix those things the quicker this product will release.

Alternatively you can help by spreading the word, adding to the documentation,
providing new artwork and/or contributing money to my
[Ko-fi](https://www.ko-fi.com/treacherousnexus) or
[Liberapay](https://liberapay.com/TreacherousNexus/) accounts.

## How will the package versions work?
I intend to mirror the Wilber package version to the upstream version of the
GNU Image Manipulation Program that it tracks. The first release will therefore
be v2.10.12, as that was the latest tagged release when this project started.

## How can I keep up to date with Wilber's progress?
For now, follow [Bobby Moss](https://bobadon.co.uk/@bob) on the fediverse. In
the near future he will create a proper "project" account for people to follow.
You can also "star" or "watch" this Github repository to keep up-to-date with
code-level changes.
