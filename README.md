# Glimpse

Glimpse is a downstream fork of the GNU Image Manipulation Program. You can find out more information on our FAQs page: https://getglimpse.app/about/

## What is different about Glimpse?
For now, not a lot! The initial aim is to provide a downstream fork of the GNU Image Manipulation Program that has a less problematic name so there are no barriers to using the software in businesses and educational institutions.

This is a long-standing problem that has drawn user concern for over a decade, but whenever the issue is raised it tends to be dismissed. We do not believe the upstream project's [explanation or workaround](https://www.gimp.org/docs/userfaq.html#i-dont-like-the-name-gimp-will-you-change-it) is enough to address the problem.

In future versions we intend to address other long-standing complaints, particularly around the graphical user interface.

## How will the package versions work?
Glimpse 1.0 will be a simple re-branding of the GNU Image Manipulation Program based on version 2.10.12, with some minor fixes to the build system. You can see how this effort is going in the [dev-g210](https://github.com/glimpse-editor/Glimpse/tree/dev-g210) branch.

Subsequent releases will "hard fork" from the upstream project, but we will still periodically apply upstream updates in batches.

## How can I keep up to date with Glimpse's progress?
Our official project website is now live (but still under construction) at https://getglimpse.app.
